### Vending Machine Application 
- Built using .NET with the capability to deposit money, choose products, and receive change. Transaction information was stored in an audit log file, and a sales report file could be created on demand. Utilized multiple classes and polymorphism, stored sales and inventory information.

### Command Line Logic Game 
- Designed in Java, in which a Minesweeper field was built, and the player would guess where the mines were. Information about how many hits/how close the guesses were was presented to the player, and they could guess again. Like the game Mastermind, the goal was to minimize guesses.
